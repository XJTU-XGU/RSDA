<!-- # Robust Spherical Domain Adaptation -->
<!-- Code for paper "Xiang Gu, Jian Sun, Zongben Xu, **Spherical Space Domain Adaptation with Robust Pseudo-label Loss**, IEEE Conf. on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020". -->
## Prerequisites:
Python==3.6.13 <br>
Pytorch ==1.5.1 <br>
Torchvision ==0.6.0 <br>
Numpy==1.19.2 <br>
Scipy==1.5.4 <br>
Scikit-learn==0.17.1 <br>
## Initialization:
To obtain the initial model, run 
```
python train_init.py --source amazon --target dslr
```
The returned accuracy is the result of method "MSTN+S" in our paper. The trained initial model can also be found at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PsaCpuwQt1NJwS4UjmvdtES_f9RK0NBP?usp=sharing.
## Training:
Download the initial model and put it into the folder "./save/init_model". Then run
```
python train_with_pseudo_label.py --source amazon --target dslr
```
## Results
We run the code on a single NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU, the results are as follows.<br>
|A->D|A->W|D->A|W->A|
|------|------|------|------|
|96.7|95.9|77.9|78.4|
