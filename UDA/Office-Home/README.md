# Robust Spherical Domain Adaptation
Code for paper "Xiang Gu, Jian Sun, Zongben Xu, **Spherical Space Domain Adaptation with Robust Pseudo-label Loss**, IEEE Conf. on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020".
## Prerequisites:
Python==3.6.13 <br>
Pytorch ==1.5.1 <br>
Torchvision ==0.6.0 <br>
Numpy==1.19.2 <br>
Scipy==1.5.4 <br>
Scikit-learn==0.17.1 <br>
## Initialization:
To obtain the initial model, run 
```
python train_init.py --source Art --target Clipart
```
The returned accuracy is the result of method "MSTN+S" in our paper. The trained initial model can also be found at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Rt6crgL4-n9ZGzXLjGw0wmvk4GxlUpGI?usp=sharing.
## Training:
Download the initial model and put it into the folder "./save/init_model". Then run
```
python train_with_pseudo_label.py --source Art --target Clipart
```
## Results
We run the code on a single NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU, the results are as follows. The results are higher than those reported in the original paper.<br>
|Method |Ar-Cl|Ar-Pr|Ar-Rw|Cl-Ar|Cl-Pr|Cl-Rw|Pr-Ar|Pr-Cl|Pr-Rw|Rw-Ar|Rw-Cl|Rw-Pr|Avg|
